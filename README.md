# More Than A Game

This collaboration between Destiny Ratsavong, Berekt Ashenafi, Julian Graves, and Michael Frabott is a concept that allows a user to search for their favorite college football team's schedule and subsequently populate local attractions in the city where the game is taking place and other sports and music events happening within a couple days of the game. Allowing the user to see what's going on aside from the game - they can plan a weekend full of activities all from one spot. 

This application utilizes three third=party APIs: CollegeFootballData API, Ticketmaster Discovery API, and openTripMap API. Due to authoriztion issues with the College Football Data API, the entire 2022 football season and stadium calls are stored locally and are not live to the API.

Once the initial pseudo-call is made to retrieve the user's selected team's schedule, they are afforded the opportunity to select any of the games on the schedule to initiate calls to the other APIs where they are presented with the relevant results.
